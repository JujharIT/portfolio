1. fix the mobile screen menu toggle issue- something wrong with bootstrap- set timeout of couple seconds and then menu
collapses back
2. fix the scroll down image in home-banner- make it appear across all screen sizes
3. make the robot larger to cover more of screen
4. portfolio section:
    - add the AJAX, react capability that the section updates only (not the entire page or doesnt take to a diff.
    portfolio page), use the single page web app that:
        - portfolio looks like caferati's page and shows tech names/subsections above and shows the project thumbnails
         below. when clicked on the thumbnail: only the porfolio section reloads and shows the details of selected
         project.
5. controll scroll on website like: http://jsfiddle.net/36dp03ur/891/
